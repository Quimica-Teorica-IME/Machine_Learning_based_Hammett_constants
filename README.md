In this repository, you will find the optimized geometries of 90 meta-, 90 para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives and 90 substituted benzene derivatives, and two Excel files (ML-HammettConstants-ORCA.xlsx and ChelpG-Gaussian09.xlsx) containing the atomic charges of the carbon atoms in the core structure (benzene ring) of the aforementioned systems.

These carbon charges were calculated by single-point calculations at the CAM-B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level upon B3LYP/Def2-TZVP-optimized structures and considered the Mulliken, Loewdin, Hirshfeld, and ChelpG models. All quantum chemical calculations were performed with the ORCA 5.0.3 and Gaussian 09 software package. You will also find our inputs here. 

The variations of the carbon charges were obtained by subtracting the charge of a carbon atom in an unsubstituted benzoic acid (or benzene) system from the respective carbon atom in the substituted derivatives listed above.

The variations of the carbon charges were then used in our Machine-Learning (ML)-based procedure to calculate Hammettâ€™s constants. The ML algorithm considered in the aforementioned Excel file is the Lasso Lars IC. The Leave-One-Out Cross Validation was also considered. The Python scripts used to carry out these analysis are also present in this directory (ML-python-scripts.zip)
