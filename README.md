In this repository, you will find an Excel file containing the atomic charges of the carbon atoms in the core structure (benzene ring) of:

1) 90 meta-substituted benzoic acid derivatives;
2) 90 para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives; and
3) 90 mono-substituted benzene derivatives.

These carbon charges were calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), at the CAM-B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level, of B3LYP/Def2-TZVP-optimized structures, and considering the Mulliken, Loewdin, Hirshfeld, and ChelpG models. All quantum chemical calculations were performed with the ORCA software package.

The variations of the carbon charges were obtained by subtracting the charge of a carbon atom in an unsubstituted benzoic acid (or benzene) derivative from the respective carbon atom in the substituted derivatives listed above.

The variations of the carbon charges were then used in our Machine-Learning (ML)-based procedure to calculate Hammettâ€™s constants. The ML algorithm considered in the aforementioned Excel file is the Lasso Lars IC.
