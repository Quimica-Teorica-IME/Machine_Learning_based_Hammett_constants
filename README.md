In this repository, you will find the optimized geometries of 90 meta- and 90 para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives, 90 substituted benzene derivatives, and an Excel file (ML-HammettConstants.xlsx) containing the atomic charges of the carbon atoms in the core structure (benzene ring) of:

1) 90 meta-substituted benzoic acid derivatives;
2) 90 para-substituted benzoic acid derivatives; and
3) 90 mono-substituted benzene derivatives.

These carbon charges were calculated by at the CAM-B3LYP/Def2-TZVP level upon B3LYP/Def2-TZVP-optimized structures and considering the Mulliken, Loewdin, Hirshfeld, and ChelpG models. All quantum chemical calculations were performed with the ORCA 5.0.3 software package.

The variations of the carbon charges were obtained by subtracting the charge of a carbon atom in an unsubstituted benzoic acid (or benzene) derivative from the respective carbon atom in the substituted derivatives listed above.

The variations of the carbon charges were then used in our Machine-Learning (ML)-based procedure to calculate Hammettâ€™s constants. The ML algorithm considered in the aforementioned Excel file is the Lasso Lars IC. The Leave-One-Out Cross Validation was also considered.

The values of ChelpG charges calculated with ORCA 5.0.3 and Gaussian 09 are available in the ChelpG_charges-ORCA-x-GAUSSIAN.xlsx file.
